## Description

The Sign Out endpoint is a DELETE request that allows authenticated users to log out or sign out from the system. When a user initiates the sign-out process by sending a DELETE request to this endpoint, their existing authentication session will be invalidated, and they will no longer have access to protected resources until they sign in again.

## Endpoint URL

```
DELETE /api/profile/
```

## Request Headers

The client should include the following headers in the request:

- `Authorization`: The authentication token obtained during the sign-in process should be included in the `Authorization` header. The token is usually prefixed with a token type, such as "Token". For example: `Authorization: Token eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`

## Response

Upon successful sign-out, the endpoint does not return any response body. The HTTP response status code will indicate the success or failure of the sign-out process.

## Example

**Request**

```
DELETE /api/profile/
Authorization: Token eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**Response**

```
204 No Content
```

## Authentication

The Sign Out endpoint uses token-based authentication. To access this endpoint, clients must include a valid authentication token in the request headers. The token should be obtained during the sign-in process, and it should be sent in the `Authorization` header using the "Token" scheme.

If the provided authentication token is invalid, expired, or does not belong to an authenticated user, the server will respond with a `401 Unauthorized` status code, indicating that the user is not authorized to sign out.

## Status Codes

- `204 No Content`: The request was successful, and the user has been signed out. There is no response body.
- `401 Unauthorized`: The provided authentication token is invalid or has expired. The user is not authorized to sign out, which might indicate that the token is already invalid or has been tampered with.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on the server while processing the request.

## Notes

- When a user signs out, it is essential to invalidate their authentication session on the server side. This may involve clearing any server-side session data or revoking the user's access token if applicable.
- Clients should securely manage and store the authentication token. Upon successful sign-out, the client should remove the token from local storage or memory to prevent unauthorized access.
- For enhanced security, the sign-out endpoint should be protected, and only authenticated users should have access to it.
- It's crucial to use HTTPS for this endpoint to ensure the secure transmission of sensitive data, such as the authentication token.
