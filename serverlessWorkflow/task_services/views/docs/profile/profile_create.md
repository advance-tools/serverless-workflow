## Description

The Sign In endpoint is a POST request that allows users to authenticate and obtain an access token by providing their email and password. The endpoint verifies the user's credentials and returns the user's email along with an authentication token upon successful authentication.

## Endpoint URL

```
POST /api/profile/
```

## Request Parameters

The Sign In endpoint requires the following parameters in the request body:

- `email` (string): The email address of the user trying to sign in.
- `password` (string): The password associated with the user's account.

## Request Headers

The client should include the following headers in the request:

- `Content-Type`: Set this header to `application/json` to indicate that the request body is in JSON format.

## Response

The response of the POST request will be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

- `email` (string): The email address of the authenticated user.
- `token` (string): An authentication token generated for the user. The token is typically a JSON Web Token (JWT) that can be used in subsequent requests to authenticate the user.

## Example

**Request**

```
POST /api/profile/
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
}
```

**Response**

```json
{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

## Status Codes

- `200 OK`: The request was successful, and the user has been authenticated. The response contains the user's email and authentication token.
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was invalid or missing required parameters (e.g., email or password).
- `401 Unauthorized`: The provided email and password combination is incorrect, and the user could not be authenticated.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on the server while processing the request.

## Notes

- The authentication token returned in the response should be securely stored by the client application and included in subsequent requests to authenticate the user for protected endpoints.
- To enhance security, consider implementing rate-limiting and other security measures to protect against brute-force attacks on the sign-in endpoint.
- It's essential to use HTTPS for this endpoint to ensure the secure transmission of sensitive user data.
- Consider implementing mechanisms for password reset and account recovery in case users forget their passwords.
