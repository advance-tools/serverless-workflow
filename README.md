ServerlessWorkflow is a Python Django project designed to provide an event-driven orchestration mechanism for your applications. With its serverless architecture, it can scale down to zero, making it a perfect choice for modern, scalable applications.

## Features

- Event-driven orchestration for your project
- Serverless architecture for automatic scaling
- Init and Complete events to manage task execution
- Supports parallel and nested triggering of events
- Executes complex and dynamic graphs

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with the ServerlessWorkflow project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Python 3.7 or higher recommended)
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/#install-pipenv) for virtual environment setup

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/advance-tools/serverless-workflow.git
cd ServerlessWorkflow
```

2. Set up the virtual environment using Pipenv:

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
pipenv shell
```

4. Run database migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

## Local Development

To run the Django project locally, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The development server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Deployment

For production deployment, it is recommended to use a WSGI server like Gunicorn. The provided `Pipfile` includes the necessary dependencies for Gunicorn. To install Gunicorn, run:

```bash
pipenv install gunicorn
```

To start the application with Gunicorn, use the following command:

```bash
gunicorn serverlessWorkflow.wsgi:application
```
